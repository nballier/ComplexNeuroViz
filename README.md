# Aim

**ComplexNeuroViz : Complexity Visualisation for Neural Machine Translation**

This project aims at improving visualisation of neural networks when they process linguistic data in the context of neural translation. The analysis of neural networks with visualization toolkits mainly focused on the activation of layers and neurons for classification tasks. Compared to the two state-of-the-art visualization toolkits for neural translation, our major contribution consists in adding one currently neglected set of features in Feature Visualization: linguistic complexity. The aim of this project is to adapt current neural visualization toolkits to visualize and diagnose attention weights and linguistic complexity metrics in order to analyse the effects of the complexity of the linguistic input at token level, at phrase level and at sentence level.
